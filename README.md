'Challenge 2'
The one year script will run through one year of stocks and return the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change and total volume.
I also added 3 three new cells to the file: Greatest % Increase/Decrease and Greatest Total Volume
The second script does the same tasks as the first script but the loop runs through every worksheet in the Spreadsheet.
